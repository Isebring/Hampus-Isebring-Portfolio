# Hampus Isebrings Portfolio

#### In this assignment I have created a personal portfolio webpage where I present myself, my skills and projects I have worked on. As for now I only link to my Figma portfolio.

I wanted to showcase some pictures from my life to give a quick view of things that are valuable to me. Kl√§ssbol, which I show in two of the images is a place that has been in my family for a long time. To all my relatives, it is a place to recover from the daily stress of life and just reflect and spend time together.

*I decided not to rewrite my whole CV as I have one already. Instead I focused on presenting other things about me and implemented a download button where my CV can be downloaded as PDF.*

*The purpose of the landing page is to simply give a quick insight of my roles as front end developer student and junior ux | ui designer. If that catches the users' interest a simple click leads them to the main page.*


[Live Demo here](https://isebring.github.io/..).

**Notes:**
*As for now it is responsive until about 300 px.*
*I have used particles.js and swiper.js libraries for this assignment.*
